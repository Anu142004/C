# Master Theorem in Divide-and-Conquer

This repository provides a concise explanation of the **Master Theorem**, a tool for analyzing the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The Master Theorem helps solve recurrence relations of the form:

\[
T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + O(n^d)
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the input size.
- \( a \) is the number of subproblems.
- \( \frac{n}{b} \) is the size of each subproblem.
- \( O(n^d) \) is the cost of dividing the problem and combining results.

## Master Theorem Cases

The time complexity depends on the comparison between \( a \) and \( b^d \), resulting in three different cases:

### Case 1: Subproblem Work Dominates

If \( a > b^d \), the recursive work dominates:
\[
T(n) = O(n^{\log_b a})
\]

### Case 2: Recursive and Non-Recursive Work are Balanced

If \( a = b^d \), the work is balanced between the recursive and non-recursive parts:
\[
T(n) = O(n^d \log n)
\]

### Case 3: Non-Recursive Work Dominates

If \( a < b^d \), the non-recursive work dominates:
\[
T(n) = O(n^d)
\]

## Example: Merge Sort

The recurrence relation for **Merge Sort** is:

\[
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(n)
\]

Where:
- \( a = 2 \) (2 subproblems),
- \( b = 2 \) (subproblem size halved),
- \( d = 1 \) (linear time to merge).

Since \( a = b^d \), this falls under **Case 2**, resulting in a time complexity of:

\[
T(n) = O(n \log n)
\]

## Conclusion

The Master Theorem is a useful tool for analyzing the efficiency of divide-and-conquer algorithms by solving recurrences and determining time complexity. It categorizes problems into three cases based on the relationship between recursive and non-recursive work.
